# FetchingDataFromApi Project

The "FetchingDataFromApi Project" is a React project designed to demonstrate fetching data from an API and implementing CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) using Redux Toolkit. It showcases how to interact with a backend server to manage user data within a React application.

## Features

- **Fetching Users:** Utilizes the `useGetUsersQuery` hook to fetch a list of users from the API.
- **Adding Users:** Employs the `useAddUserMutation` hook to add a new user to the API.
- **Updating Users:** Utilizes the `useUpdateUserMutation` hook to update an existing user in the API.
- **Deleting Users:** Uses the `useDeleteUserMutation` hook to delete a user from the API.

## Additional Notes
- **Run the development server in VScode**:

   ```bash
   npx json-server db.json
   ```
- Ensure that the API server is running and accessible at `http://localhost:3000`.
- Customize and extend the functionality as needed to suit project requirements.
- This project serves as a foundational example for building more complex applications that interact with backend servers and manage application state efficiently.

## Technologies Used

- **React:** A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Redux Toolkit:** An opinionated toolset for efficient Redux development, used for state management.
- **React Query:** A data-fetching library for React applications, providing caching, pagination, and real-time updates.
- **Tailwind CSS:** A utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom designs.

## Project Structure
- **App.jsx:** The primary component responsible for rendering the user interface and handling user interactions.
- **Api.js:** Defines API endpoints using Redux Toolkit's `createApi` function, enabling communication with the backend server.
- **index.css:** Contains global styles for the application, including font styles, colors, and layout configurations.
- **index.js:** The entry point of the application, rendering the `App` component into the DOM.
- **Store.js:** Configures the Redux store with middleware and reducers, integrating the API slice into the store.
- **components:** Contains reusable components used throughout the application for modularity and scalability.

## React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
